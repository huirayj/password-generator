# password-generator

#Overview
In the following exercise, when the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is asked to input a desired length, whether the password would include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters, and then a password is randomly created based off those selected choices. Functions, arrays, if/else statements, "for" loops, and Math.random() were emphasized in making this project work.
